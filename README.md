# How to record and play video in iOS 10.3 and Swift 3.1 (updated 04-06-17)

The purpose of this repository is to supplement the ["How to record and play video in iOS 9 and Swift 2.0"](http://www.deegeu.com/how-to-capture-video-in-ios-and-swift/) video with code, and to provide a simple starting point for building basic video functionality in your apps.

The “How to record and play video in iOS 9 and Swift 2.0” video demonstrates recording a video, saving it to your documents directory, and the playing it back. **The code is updated for Swift 3.1 and iOS 10.3, so it differs from the original video.**
